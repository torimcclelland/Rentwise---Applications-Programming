# Misc notes Sam put here

Note from Sam: I have a bit of a specific notation that may or may not appear in my code by habit, so here's an explanation in case it does. These are words that may appear in comments mostly so I can find areas I was working on easily and quickly.

- "KELSIER": immediately relevant or important, also "TODO"
- "WAXILLIUM": Likely to be relevant to what I'm working on next, AKA 'jump here when you start on the next item'
- "MARSH": clean this up later

### Research/documentation/useful resources

For app.json file set up: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#android

For fireSTORE set up with EXPO set up: https://rnfirebase.io/ 

Seems relevant to the firestore initialization mystery: 

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76762689/how-to-use-firestore-persistence-on-react-native-expo-app
- https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart (VERY IMPORTANT AND USEFUL)

Typescript cheatsheet: https://www.typescriptlang.org/cheatsheets/

React Navigation: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/hello-react-navigation?config=dynamic

Retrieving data in batches: https://rnfirebase.io/firestore/usage-with-flatlists
^ check out the Canvas page, seems incredibly relevant


## Checkpoint notes:

- Fluff stuff first
- Do not lose audience, don't just jump right into an IDE
- Set the stage
    - what we did, what we accomplished, show what we accomplished
- show data storage, at least show it exists
    - and during demo, show "here's front, here's back, here's the data moving between the two"
- for demoing different components, make a demo page, show them all. Don't do "here's the file structure, here's the code". Then demo the structure/code of one or two components

- 8 total checkpoints
- after the 8th, we'll focus on finishing the functionality of our app and preparing for a final presentation. won't have checkpoints after that, but will keep progressing


next up for sam: check that the merged changes work!
