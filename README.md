# Notes on checkpoints

- Use template on Canvas for project status checkpoint every week
    - He will deduct points for not listing team members
    - There's a good amount of flexibility in how you put it all in there
    - "Code Changes": maybe highlight certain key changes, don't copy/paste every change
    - Record video of weekly update
        - Present, as though to team or business to tell what we worked on
        - Quick highlights, quick and snappy and efficient, do NOT go line-by-line
        - Show items we worked on working
        - Examples given, do better than them!
        - Video length depends on what you did. Should not be super long, though. 5-12 minutes is a good range.
    - change log
        - either changes made to code for that cycle
        - OR running list of changes since the start (my preference)
- New requirement: presentation must all be on the same branch!
